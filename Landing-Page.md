# Luca06Luwa's Modified Homebrew Guides

## What is Homebrew?
Homebrew applications are custom, user-made software, which haven’t been authorized by the console manufacturer. This can include save editing tools, games, emulators, and more.

Homebrew can be run on your respective console as long as you have a way to put files on to either a USB or SD card and your console is updated to the latest version for your region.

## What is Custom Firmware?
Custom firmware (often abbreviated as "CFW") enables you to use more advanced hacks that userland homebrew can’t easily do. For instance, installing game modifications with ease. CFW can be set up on any console on the latest version.

## End Goal
These guides all have the end goal of taking a completely unmodified console from stock to custom firmware.
